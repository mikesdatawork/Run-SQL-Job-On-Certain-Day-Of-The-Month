## About-Process

<p>Someone recently asked me how to setup a job to run on a certain day. In this case it's the 3rd day of the month. There is one simple solution which can do that. Unfortunately; it means a job has to run every day, but that's not a big deal really.
You just have to create Step 1 to check on today. If today is NOT the 3rd day of the month then STOP the current job. If it is the current day, then do nothing and the job will proceed to the next step.</p> 



## SQL-Logic
```SQL
use master;
set nocount on
 
declare @today datetime = (select dateadd(d, -0, datediff(d, 0, getdate())))
declare @3rd   datetime = (select dateadd(day, 2, dateadd(month, datediff(month, 0, getdate()), 0)))
 
if @today <> @3rd
    begin
        print 'today is NOT the 3rd day'
        exec msdb..sp_stop_job 'my job name'
    end
        else
            print 'today is the 3rd'
```

You might be thinking… "Doesn't this throw an error, or alert on the job?" Nope :) Basically what happens is the Job does not 'fail'. It's simply 'cancelled'. This is basically the same thing whenever you right-click a job and select 'Stop Job'. So although the agent history will show a nasty red icon next to the run history; it's not a 'failure'. It still only means it was stopped (cancelled) as you can see below by the Job history.
If you're interested; here's the quick test I created.
I created a 2 step Job.
Step 1: Check to see if it's the 3rd day. If not; Stops the Job. If so… do nothing and continue to the next step as usual.
Step 2: Backup the Model database.
Here's the results of the Job after it's cancelled from within the Step 1.

I ran the Job a second time where @today = @today just to confirm the success, and it worked no problem.
Now; if you're looking for a business day; you can try this:



## SQL-Logic
```SQL
use master;
set nocount on
 
declare @year_start        datetime
declare @year_finish       datetime
declare @today             datetime = (select dateadd(d, -0, datediff(d, 0, getdate())))
declare @daydiff           int

                     and dateadd(day,daynum,@year_start) not in (select holiday from @holidays)
       )      sc_a
where BusinessDay = 3
 
if     @today not in(select [date] from @3rd_biz_day)
       begin
              print 'today is NOT the 3rd business day'
              exec  msdb..sp_stop_job 'my job name'
       end
       else
              print 'today is the 3rd business day - continue to next job step'
